# Exercise 8: Form

Add an event listener to the submit button of the form. Get the data out of the different input elements, put it an object and push it into the `data` array that's already defined for you in the exercise.

After every submit, reset the form so all the inputs are empty again.

Important!: Make sure you cancel the default browser behaviour of the form
